Object:
  //  Objects: JavaScript objects are fundamental data structures that enable the organization and storage of data in the form of key-value pairs.
  //  Objects are unordered collection of key value pairs. These key-value pairs, known as properties.

 1.  There can be typically four ways to create an Object in JavaScript.
  // Using object literal.
  // Using new keyword
  // Using Object.create() method
  // Using Factory functions
  // Using Constructor functions

 
 Using object literal
  // Object literal is a list of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces '{}'.

 #  Every object has properties, which are represented in JavaScript as key-value pairs.

 Key : 
  //  In JavaScript key must either be strings or valid identifier or variable names. 
  //  Expressions cannot be keys,also special characters are not allowed in key names that are not strings.

 Value :
  //  Value can be anything such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, functions and even objects.
 
 #  When a function is a property of an object, it is also referred to as a method.

 ===============================================================================================================

 # To access the value of a particular key in an object, we typically use two notations:
   //  Dot Notation

       const person = {
                 name: 'Mayank',
                 age: 21,
                 message: function() {
              console.log('Hellooooooo!');
                }
              };

             let myName = person.name;
             console.log(myName);
             let myAge = person.age;
             console.log(myAge);
             let message = person.message();



   //  Bracket Notation

         
         const person = {
             name: 'Mayank',
              age: 21,
                message: function() {
                 console.log('Hellooooooo!');
                  }
               };

               let myName = person["name"];
                  console.log(myName);
                let myAge = person["age"];
                console.log(myAge);
               let message = person["message"]();

  

  **   You most be thinking that why two different ways to access the properties what is the difference, and which one is more convenient?. 
  //  The answer is "we cannot use Dot Notation when the property name or method of an object contains special characters, space or starts with a number".

 #  In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

  //  Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
  //  Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
  //  Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
  //  Dates are always objects
  //  Maths are always objects
  //  Regular expressions are always objects
  //  Arrays are always objects
  //  Functions are always objects
  //  Objects are always objects
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
