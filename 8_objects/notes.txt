Object:
  //  Objects: JavaScript objects are fundamental data structures that enable the organization and storage of data in the form of key-value pairs.
  //  Objects are unordered collection of key value pairs. These key-value pairs, known as properties.

 1.  There can be typically four ways to create an Object in JavaScript.
  // Using object literal.
  // Using new keyword
  // Using Object.create() method
  // Using Factory functions
  // Using Constructor functions

 
 Using object literal
  // Object literal is a list of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces '{}'.

 #  Every object has properties, which are represented in JavaScript as key-value pairs.

 Key : 
  //  In JavaScript key must either be strings or valid identifier or variable names. 
  //  Expressions cannot be keys,also special characters are not allowed in key names that are not strings.

 Value :
  //  Value can be anything such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, functions and even objects.
 
 #  When a function is a property of an object, it is also referred to as a method.


 #  In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

  //  Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
  //  Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
  //  Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
  //  Dates are always objects
  //  Maths are always objects
  //  Regular expressions are always objects
  //  Arrays are always objects
  //  Functions are always objects
  //  Objects are always objects
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
