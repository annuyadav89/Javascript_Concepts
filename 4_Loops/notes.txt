   //  We often need to repeat actions.
  //   For example, outputting goods from a list one after another or just running the same code for each number from 1 to 10.
 //    Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.

  //   while – The condition is checked before each iteration.
 //    do..while – The condition is checked after each iteration.
//     for (;;) – The condition is checked before each iteration, additional settings available.
