// A switch statement can replace multiple if checks.
// It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.
// The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
// Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

// This is how it works:

    The switch expression is evaluated once.
    The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
    If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
    If there is no match, the default code block is executed.


The Break Keyword
 // If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case.
 // When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
 // This will stop the execution inside the switch block.
 // It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.


The default Keyword
    //  The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match:
    //  The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block:
    //  If default is not the last case in the switch block, remember to end the default case with a break.
