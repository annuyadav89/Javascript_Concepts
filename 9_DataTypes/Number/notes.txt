  //  JavaScript has only one type of number. 
  //  Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
  
  ex:  let x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
       let y = 3;       // A number without decimals


  // Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponent) notation:
   Example
      let x = 123e5;    // 12300000
      let y = 123e-5;   // 0.00123
