 // Mocha => LiveScript => JavaScript

2. Scripting Languages
 // Scripting languages are those languages which are interpreted rather than compiled.
 // executed line-by-line by the interpreter at the runtime thus allowing for quicker development cycles and easier debugging.
 // Scripting languages are commonly used for tasks such as system administration, web development, text processing and automation.
 

 // client side scripting language (scripting - line by line execution)
 // javascript make web page interactive and dynamic
 // opensource(free) and cross-platform(any os it will support)
 // case sensitive (difference between capital and small letter)
 // It is supported in all the browser 
 // lightweight and object(noun) oriented programming 
 // It is used in both places client side and server side.
 // library/framework : Reactjs,angular,Vuejs 
 // DOM - Document Object Model - Helps to interact with html

3. Programming Languages
 //  Programming languages are compiled languages, which means the source code is compiled to convert it to machine code.
 //  A programming language is a computer language which is used to communicate with computers using a set of instructions. 
 //  Programming languages utilize compilers and do not rely on interpretation by another language or application.


4. Two ways of writing Javascript 
  1.internal 
    // anywhere inside the html tag you can write it.
    // Best place is inside the head tag.
      example:
           <script>
             alert("hello world")
           </script>

   2.external
          external.js 
            alert("hello world")

5. JavaScript Engines for Executing JavaScript Code
  // A JavaScript engine is the software that takes our JavaScript code and translates it into instructions that your computer can understand. 
  // It is like a powerful interpreter.

  Some of the most popular JS engines today are :
    1.  V8
       //  Developed by Google, V8 is one of the most widely used JavaScript engines. 
       //  It powers the JavaScript execution in Google Chrome and Node.js.

    2.  SpiderMonkey 
       // Developed by Mozilla Firefox, SpiderMonkey is the JavaScript engine used in the Firefox web browser.
       // It was one of the first JavaScript engines ever created and is known for its performance and compliance with JavaScript standards.

    3. JavaScriptCore 
       // Used in Safari, known for its tight integration with Apple devices.

    4. Chakra 
       // Developed by Microsoft, Chakra was the JavaScript engine used in the Edge web browser. 
       // It has now been replaced by the Chromium-based Edge browser, which uses V8 as its JavaScript engine.
